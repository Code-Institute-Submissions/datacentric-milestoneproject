## Design
To assist with the design of the website I used grids, nav, carousel and cards from Materialize. The aim of this website
was to have a colourful and bold website that would be pleasing to user eye. I attempted to keep the design simple and not
overcrowd the page with too much information. 

I used resources available to me on Slack by the tutors and used the following document as guide:

- I maintained website conventions to allow a user to find what they want easily eg. nav bar at the top, 
clearly labelled buttons, search field at the top of the page.
- I used subtle but effective user actions for example hover effects for buttons and navbar.
- I provided bite size information and ensured not to overload the user with information.
- I have attempted to create a simple design which does not force the user to "go looking" for what they want.
- I have used colours which provide comfortable viewing for individuals with learning disabilities such as Dyslexia. i.e minimal use of white.
- I used styling commonly found on modern websites (see PDF above) such as border radius for buttons, box shadows with colour and borders.

## Colours
- Due to using alot of images which are extremely colourful, I chose a simple background colour which would not clash with the colours of the images.
- As someone who is Dyslexic, the use of white is extremely challenging to read from due to being sensitive to brightness.
White also makes words and images "swirl" making it difficult focus, I therefore chose black.
- According to information on the web, black provides a sophisticated and powerful look and when used against colour, can look modern.

- I used a lighter colour inside bordered boxes to make it easier on the eye for the viewer and prevent it from being too dark.
- I looked at movie review websites such as Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, Flixster and saw that they used simple colour backgrounds i.e. white, gray or black,
with the use of bold colours and lots of images to create additional colour and I therefore attempted to use a similar colour scheme.
